Engineering Physics graduate from EEL-USP, Pedro calls himself an “entanglement” of engineer and physicist. He works with DFT and superconductivity modelling, exploring electronic properties and phonons in materials and alloys.

At ComputEEL/MatSci he leads graduate projects on quantum materials, combining theory, algorithms and visualizations to accelerate discoveries.

Topics of interest: superconductivity, electron–phonon coupling, DFT workflows, materials informatics.
