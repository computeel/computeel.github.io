From Paraíba do Sul (RJ), Ana has always enjoyed understanding how things are made. Strong in Math and Physics in high school, she found in Engineering a way to turn curiosity into solutions.

At ComputEEL/MatSci she applies thermodynamics and simulations to investigate alloys and intermetallics, developing computational tools during her degree.

Topics of interest: alloy design, thermodynamics, simulation workflows for students.
