Born in São Paulo, Luiz is a metallurgical engineer (Poli-USP, 2001). He explored the Cluster Variation Method in his master’s, spent four and a half years at the Max Planck Institute for Iron Research (MPIE) in Düsseldorf working on alloy thermodynamics, and later was a guest researcher at CIRIMAT/Université de Toulouse.

His PhD focused on empirical and ab initio data in the CALPHAD method (2012), followed by a postdoc in Physics at IF-USP. Since 2014 he has been a professor at DEMAR/EEL-USP, working with DFT, CALPHAD, electronic and thermal properties of alloys and intermetallics, and teaching Thermodynamics, Statistical Physics, Quantum Mechanics and Scientific Computing.

Research interests:

- Ab initio calculations for superconductors, alloys and intermetallic compounds.
- Thermodynamic modelling and CALPHAD databases.
- Electronic/thermal properties, phase stability and structure–property relationships.
