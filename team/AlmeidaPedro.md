From Pitangueiras (SP), Pedro has long been fascinated by how the universe works. In high school that curiosity grew and led him to Engineering, where he found in ComputEEL/MatSci a place to apply modelling to materials.

He served as a member of the group during undergrad, contributing to studies and simulations of materials.

Topics of interest: materials modelling, physics-informed Engineering projects.
