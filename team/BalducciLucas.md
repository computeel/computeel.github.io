Born and raised in São Paulo, Lucas has always been curious about how our connection to nature shapes who we are. That curiosity led him to Engineering Physics, looking for a deep view of the universe.

His first contact with Materials Science and Scientific Computing came through ComputEEL/MatSci. He now conducts undergraduate research in the group, combining materials modelling and computational tools in projects on electronic structure and alloys.

Topics of interest: electronic-structure calculations, materials design, scientific computing.
