Born in 2001 in the countryside of São Paulo, João Pedro has always wondered how much knowledge we can gain and how research can change the world. That curiosity led him to Engineering Physics and undergraduate research.

At ComputEEL/MatSci he works with computational modelling and materials, learning to translate curiosity into concrete projects that blend theory and technological impact.

Topics of interest: materials simulation, data-driven methods and reproducible research practices.
